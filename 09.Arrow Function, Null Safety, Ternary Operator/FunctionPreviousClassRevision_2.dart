// Revision of previous class

// This is Optional plus named Function we use
// curely braces <{}> for this,if you don't not
// pass any arguments then you will not get any error
// and you have not to worry to provide detail in sequence
// order like first is name so you have to provide first
// name it does not matter because it will helighted named
// field

void main() {
  StudentInfo(); // there is no any error, i didn't pass any arguments
  // both are optional, and named
  //
}

// Function defined here
StudentInfo({name, city}) {
  print("Name : $name");
  print("City : $city");
  //i use curely braces inside the round brackets i have already removed
  // datatypes for removing errors in function we will discuss these
  // errors in null safety (we will in this lecture)
  // to handle these errors
  // to keep or prevent datatypes with (we will learn in this lecture)
