  // Polymorphism
  // Polymorphism has two types 
  //1. Overloading
  //2. Overriding

//Polymorphism in Dart refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated
//as objects of a common superclass. This allows you to write flexible code that can work with
//various objects without knowing their exact types at compile time. There are two main ways to achieve polymorphism in Dart:

//Method Overriding: This is a core concept in inheritance. When a subclass inherits from a parent class,
//it can redefine methods inherited from the parent class to provide its own implementation.
//This allows you to have a single method name with different behaviors depending on the object's actual type.
