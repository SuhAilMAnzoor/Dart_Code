Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP)
that revolves around bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate
on that data together within a single unit called a class. It's like creating
a self-contained package for a specific functionality.

Here are the key aspects of encapsulation:

Data Hiding:Encapsulation promotes information hiding. This means you can restrict
direct access to an object's internal data (attributes) from external code.
This helps protect the data integrity and prevents accidental modifications.

Access Modifiers: Most OOP languages provide access modifiers like public, private,
and protected to control the visibility of data and methods within a class. Public 
members are accessible from anywhere, private members are only accessible within
the class,and protected members are accessible within the class and subclasses.

Methods: Encapsulation encourages defining methods that manage how the data can be
accessed and manipulated. These methods, also encapsulated within the class,
act as the gatekeepers for the data, ensuring its proper usage.

Benefits of Encapsulation:

Data Protection: By hiding data, encapsulation safeguards it from unintended
modifications or errors in other parts of the code.

Modular Design: Encapsulated classes promote modularity, making the code more organized 
and easier to maintain. You can modify the internal workings of a class without affecting
other parts of the program that interact with it through its public methods.

Improved Reusability: Encapsulated classes are more reusable because their internal complexities
are hidden, and they expose a well-defined interface for interaction.

In object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation is a critical concept that binds data and
the methods that work on that data together within a single unit called a class. Imagine a class
as a blueprint for creating objects. Encapsulation acts like a shield around the data
(often referred to as attributes) within the class, restricting unwarranted access
and guaranteeing its integrity. This is typically achieved by making the data private,
which means it can't be directly accessed by other parts of the code.

However, encapsulation doesn't isolate the data completely. Public methods, also part of the class,
act as a controlled interface. These methods allow for interaction with the object's internal state
in a safe manner. To visualize this, think of a capsule containing medication. 
The capsule (the class) safeguards the medication (the data) but provides a specific opening (the methods)
to access it. This ensures the medication remains protected while still enabling its intended use.

Encapsulation offers several advantages. First and foremost, it secures the data by preventing unauthorized modification.
It also significantly improves code maintainability. Since data access is controlled, the code becomes easier to understand,
modify, and troubleshoot. Encapsulation further promotes modular design by creating self-contained units (classes) responsible
for managing their own data and behavior. In essence, encapsulation is a cornerstone of OOP that promotes the development of secure,
well-organized, and maintainable code.
