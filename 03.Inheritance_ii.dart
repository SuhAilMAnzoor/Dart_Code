//Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP)
//that allows you to create new classes (subclasses or child classes) based 
//on existing classes (parent classes or base classes). It's like inheriting 
//traits from a parent in biology.

//Reuse of Code: The subclass inherits all the properties (attributes) 
//and methods (functions) of the parent class. This saves you time and
//effort from writing the same code again.
//Hierarchical Relationships: Classes are organized in a hierarchy, 
//where subclasses inherit from parent classes, forming a parent-child relationship.
//This creates a more organized and scalable code structure.
//Specialization: Subclasses can add new properties and methods specific to their needs.
//They can also override inherited methods to provide different implementations.

//Example
//Think of animals as an example. You can have a base class Animal with properties
//like name and methods like eat and sleep. Then, you can create subclasses like Dog
//and Cat that inherit everything from Animal but also have specific methods like bark for Dog and
//purr for Cat.

//Inheritance is a powerful tool for code reusability, creating relationships between objects,
//and promoting code organization.
